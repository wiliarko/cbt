Uncle Sam, a bearded gentleman costumed in the red, white, and blue stars and stripes of the nation\u2019s flag, is another well-known national symbol. According to legend, this character is based on Samuel Wilson, the owner of a meat-packing business in Troy, New York. During the War of 1812, Sam Wilson\u2019s company was granted a government contract to supply meat to the nation\u2019s soldiers this meat was supplied to the army in barrels stamped with the initials U.S. which stood for United States. However, the country was at that time relatively young, and the initials U.S. were not commonly used. Many people questioned what the initials represented, and the standard reply became \u201cUncle Sam\u201d for the owner of the barrels. It is now generally accepted that the figure of Uncle Sam is based on Samuel Wilson, and the U.S. Congress has made it official by adopting a resolution naming Samuel Wilson as the inspiration for Uncle Sam.&nbsp;<\/span><br><\/p>","is_acak_soal":"1","acak_soal":"Acak Soal","is_acak_jawaban":"1","acak_jawaban":"Acak Jawaban","is_opsi_jawaban":"1","tipe_opsi_jawaban":"Single","file":null,"tipe_file":null,"is_enable":"1","status_data_soal":"Aktif","url_pembahasan":null,"timer":"0","pembahasan":null,"created_datetime":"2021-05-05 14:29:37","updated_datetime":null,"jawaban":""}}
