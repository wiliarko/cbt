Scientific laws assume that a specific set of conditions will unerringly lead to a predetermined outcome. However, studies in the field of physics have demonstrated that the location and speed of minuscule particles such as electrons are the result of random behaviors rather than predictable results determined pre-existing conditions. As a result of these studies, the principle of indeterminacy was formulated in 1925 by Werner Heisenberg. According to this principle, only the probable behavior of an electron can be predicted. The inability to absolutely predict the behavior of electrons casts doubt on the universal applicability of a natural law of determinism. Philosophically, the principal opposition to determinism emanates from those who see humans as creatures in possession of free will. Human decisions may be influenced by previous events, but the ultimate freedom of humanity may possibly lead to unforeseen choices, those not preordained by preceding events.<\/span><br><\/p>","is_acak_soal":"1","acak_soal":"Acak Soal","is_acak_jawaban":"1","acak_jawaban":"Acak Jawaban","is_opsi_jawaban":"1","tipe_opsi_jawaban":"Single","file":null,"tipe_file":null,"is_enable":"1","status_data_soal":"Aktif","url_pembahasan":null,"timer":"0","pembahasan":null,"created_datetime":"2021-05-06 10:40:59","updated_datetime":null,"jawaban":""}
