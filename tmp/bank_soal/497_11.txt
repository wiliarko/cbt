There are\r\nnumerous fallacies, however, in this conceptionof sharks. <o:p><\/o:p><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\">First, there are about 350 species of shark, and not all of them are large.\r\nThey range in size from the dwarf shark, which can be only 6 inches (5 feet)\r\nlong and can be held in the palm of the hand, to the whale shark, which can be\r\nmore than 55 feet long.<o:p><\/o:p><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second fallacy concerns the number and type of\r\nteeth, which can vary tremendously among the different species of shark. A\r\nshark can have from one to seven sets of teeth at the same time, and some types\r\nof shark can have several hundred teeth in each jaw. It is true that the fierce\r\nand predatory species do possess extremely sharp and brutal teeth used to rip\r\ntheir prey apart; many other types of shark, however, have teeth more adapted\r\nto grabbing and holding to cutting and slashing.<o:p><\/o:p><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 115%;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally,\r\nnot all sharks are predatory animals ready to strike out at humans on the least\r\nwhim. In fact, only 12 of the 350 species of shark have been known to attack\r\nhumans, and a shark need to be provoked in order to attack. The types of shark\r\nthat have the worst record with humans are the tiger shark, the bull shark, and\r\nthe great white shark. However, for most species of shark, even some of the\r\nlargest types, there are no known instances of attacks on humans.<\/span><br><\/p>","is_acak_soal":"1","acak_soal":"Acak Soal","is_acak_jawaban":"1","acak_jawaban":"Acak Jawaban","is_opsi_jawaban":"1","tipe_opsi_jawaban":"Single","file":null,"tipe_file":null,"is_enable":"1","status_data_soal":"Aktif","url_pembahasan":null,"timer":"0","pembahasan":null,"created_datetime":"2021-05-05 16:22:59","updated_datetime":null,"jawaban":""}}
