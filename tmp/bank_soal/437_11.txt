Black and white pepper both come from the fruit of the <\/span><i>Piper nigrum<\/i><span style=\"font-family: Poppins;\">, a vine with fruits called\r\n\r\npeppercorns. The peppercorns turn from green to red as they ripen and finally\r\n\r\nblacken as they dry out. The dried-out peppercorns are ground to obtain black\r\n\r\npepper. With pepper, which has a more subtle flavor than black pepper, comes\r\n\r\nfrom the same peppercorns as black pepper; to obtain white pepper, the outer\r\n\r\nhull of the peppercorns, the pericarp, is removed before the peppercorns is\r\n\r\nground.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;\r\n\r\nfont-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:\r\n\r\nCalibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;\r\n\r\nmso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;\r\n\r\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;\"><span style=\"font-family: Poppins;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Red\r\n\r\nand green peppers, on the other hand, come from a completely different family\r\n\r\nfrom black and white pepper. Red and green pepper are from the genus <\/span><i>Capsicum<\/i><span style=\"font-family: Poppins;\">. Plants of this type generally\r\n\r\nhave tiny white flowers and fruit which can be any one of a number colors,\r\n\r\nshapes, and sizes. These peppers range in flavor from very mild and sweet to\r\n\r\nthe most incredibly burning taste imaginable. Bell peppers are the most mild,\r\n\r\nwhile habaneros are the most burning.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;\r\n\r\nfont-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:\r\n\r\nCalibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;\r\n\r\nmso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;\r\n\r\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;\"><span style=\"font-family: Poppins;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Christopher\r\n\r\nColumbus is responsible for the present-day confusion over what a pepper is.\r\n\r\nThe <\/span><i>Piper nigrum<\/i><span style=\"font-family: Poppins;\"> variety of pepper\r\n\r\nwas highly valued for centuries, and high demand for pepper by Europeans was a\r\n\r\nmajor cause of the fifteenth-century push to locate ocean routes to the\r\n\r\nspice-growing regions pf Asia. When Columbus arrived in the New World in 1942,\r\n\r\nhe was particularly interested in finding black pepper because of the high\r\n\r\nprice that it would command in Europe. Columbus came across plants from the <\/span><i>Capsicum<\/i><span style=\"font-family: Poppins;\"> family in use among the people\r\n\r\nof the New World, and he incorrectly identified them as relatives of black\r\n\r\npepper. Columbus introduced the spicy <\/span><i>Capsicum<\/i><span style=\"font-family: Poppins;\">\r\n\r\nchill peppers to Europeans on his return from the 1492 voyage, and traders\r\n\r\nlater spread them to Asia and Africa. These <\/span><i>Capsicum<\/i><span style=\"font-family: Poppins;\">\r\n\r\npeppers have continued to be called peppers in spite of the fact that they are\r\n\r\nnot related to the black and white pepper of the <\/span><i>Piper nigrum<\/i><span style=\"font-family: Poppins;\"> family.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><br><\/p>","is_acak_soal":"1","acak_soal":"Acak Soal","is_acak_jawaban":"1","acak_jawaban":"Acak Jawaban","is_opsi_jawaban":"1","tipe_opsi_jawaban":"Single","file":null,"tipe_file":null,"is_enable":"1","status_data_soal":"Aktif","url_pembahasan":null,"timer":"0","pembahasan":null,"created_datetime":"2021-05-05 15:43:40","updated_datetime":null,"jawaban":""}}
