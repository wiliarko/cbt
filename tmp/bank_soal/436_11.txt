They stole from other ships and stole from coastal towns; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not content only to steal, they destroyed\r\n\r\neverything they could not carry away. Some of the pirate ships amassed large treasures, the fates of which\r\n\r\nare unknown, leaving people of today to wonder at their whereabouts and to\r\n\r\ndream of one day coming across some lost treasure. <o:p><\/o:p><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One\r\n\r\nnotoriously large treasure was on the pirate ship <i>Whidah, <\/i>which sank in the waters off&nbsp; Cape Cod during a strong storm in 1717. A\r\n\r\nhundred of the crew members went down with the ship, along with its treasure of\r\n\r\ncoins, gold, silver, and jewels. The treasure on board had an estimated value, on today\u2019s market, of more than\r\n\r\n100 million dollars. <o:p><\/o:p><\/p><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The\r\n\r\nremains of the <i>Whidah<\/i>&nbsp; were discovered in 1984 by Barry Clifford,\r\n\r\nWho had spent years of painstaking research and tireless searching, only to\r\n\r\nfinally locate the ship about 500 yards from&nbsp; shore. A considerable amount of treasure\r\n\r\nfrom the centuries- old ship has been recovered from its watery grave, but\r\n\r\nthere is clearly still a lot more out there. Just as a reminder of what the\r\n\r\nwaters off&nbsp; the coast have been\r\n\r\nprotecting for hundreds of years, occasional pieces of gold, or silver, or\r\n\r\njewels still wash up on the\r\n\r\nbeaches, and lucky beachgoers find pieces of the treasure.&nbsp;<o:p><\/o:p><\/p>","is_acak_soal":"1","acak_soal":"Acak Soal","is_acak_jawaban":"1","acak_jawaban":"Acak Jawaban","is_opsi_jawaban":"1","tipe_opsi_jawaban":"Single","file":null,"tipe_file":null,"is_enable":"1","status_data_soal":"Aktif","url_pembahasan":null,"timer":"0","pembahasan":null,"created_datetime":"2021-05-05 15:43:12","updated_datetime":"2021-05-05 15:44:46","jawaban":""}
