Also called levis or denims, jeans have an interesting\r\nhistory, one that is intermixed with the derivations of the words jeans, denims, and levis.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"line-height: 115%;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"line-height: 115%;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The\r\nword jeans is derived from the name\r\nof the place where a similar style of pants developed. In the sixteenth\r\ncentury, sailors from Genoa, Italy, wore a rather unique type of cotton\r\ntrousers. In the French language, the word for the city of Genoa and for the\r\npeople from that city is G<\/span><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\">e<\/span><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"line-height: 115%;\">nes; this name became attached to the specific\r\nstyle of pants worn by the sailors from this city and developed into the word jeans that today describes the\r\ndescendents of the Genovese sailor\u2019s cotton pants.<\/span><\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"line-height: 115%;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"line-height: 115%;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Similar\r\nto the word jeans, the word denim is also derived from a place name.\r\nIn the seventeenth century, French tailors began making trousers out of a\r\nspecialized type of cloth that was developed in the city of Nimes, France, and\r\nwas known as serge de Nimes. This\r\nname for the cloth underwent some transformations, and it eventually developed\r\ninto today\u2019s denim, the material from\r\nwhich jeans are made and alternate name for these popular pants.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p><p><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The\r\nword levis came from the name of a\r\nperson rather than a place. In the nineteenth century, immigrant Levi Strauss\r\ncame to America and tried his hand at selling heavy canvas to miners taking\r\npart in the hunt for gold in northern California. Strauss intended for this canvas\r\nto be used by miners to make heavy-duty tents. This first endeavor was a\r\nfailure, but Strauss later found success when he\u2019 used the heavy canvas to make\r\nindestructible pants for the miners. Levi then switched the fabric from brown\r\ncanvas to blue denim, creating a style of pants that long outlived him and\r\ntoday is referred to by his name. A modern-day urban shopper out to buy some\r\nlevis is searching for a close relative of the product that Strauss had\r\ndeveloped years earlier.<\/div><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"line-height: 115%;\"><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br><\/div><div style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14.6667px;\"><font face=\"Calibri, sans-serif\"><i><br><\/i><\/font><\/div><\/span><p><\/p><\/p>","is_acak_soal":"1","acak_soal":"Acak Soal","is_acak_jawaban":"1","acak_jawaban":"Acak Jawaban","is_opsi_jawaban":"1","tipe_opsi_jawaban":"Single","file":null,"tipe_file":null,"is_enable":"1","status_data_soal":"Aktif","url_pembahasan":null,"timer":"0","pembahasan":null,"created_datetime":"2021-05-05 16:12:39","updated_datetime":null,"jawaban":""}
